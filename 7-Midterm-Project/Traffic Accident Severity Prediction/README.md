## Traffic Accident Severity Prediction

### Project Description
Traffic accidents are an unfortunate reality, causing substantial financial losses, injuries, and even fatalities. By predicting the severity of these accidents based on specific factors, such as weather, road conditions, and time of day, this project aims to provide insights that can help emergency services prepare and allocate resources efficiently. Moreover, predicting accident severity can contribute to preventive measures for drivers and transport authorities, potentially saving lives and reducing accident severity.
