### Road Accident Prediction and Classification

Road accidents are a major global concern, causing significant loss of life, injuries, and economic costs. Understanding the patterns and factors contributing to accidents can help in implementing preventive measures and improving road safety.

This project aims to analyze road accident data to answer critical questions such as:

Which regions or areas have the most frequent accidents?
What types of streets or highways are more prone to accidents?
Which age groups are most likely to be involved in accidents?
Which areas experience higher or lower accident severity?
The project combines data analysis and machine learning to classify accident severity and predict accident likelihood based on factors such as location, weather conditions, road types, and more.
